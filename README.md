# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Kelly. Welcome to my little corner of GitHub. Here you can find all of my open source work, and follow my public activity, as well as any projects I'm working on.

## About Me

I'm a husband to a beautiful woman also named Kelli (yes Kelly and Kelli), and a father of 4  amazing boys; Tristen, Brody, Eivin, and Caleb.

I've been a freelance and open-source software developer since 2009. I have a deep appreciation of the web platform and an undying love of JavaScript. Once upon a time I mostly worked on PHP codebases, but In 2011 I stumbled upon NodeJS and shortly thereafter, Meteor, and I've been happily working in JavaScript stacks ever since.
