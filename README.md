Hi, I'm Kelly. Welcome to my little corner of GitHub. Here you can find all of my open source work, and follow my public activity, as well as any projects I'm working on.

## About Me

I'm a husband to a beautiful woman also named Kelli (yes Kelly and Kelli), and a father of 4  amazing boys; Tristen, Brody, Eivin, and Caleb.

I've been a freelance and open-source software developer since 2009. I have a deep appreciation of the web platform and an undying love of JavaScript. Once upon a time I mostly worked on PHP codebases, but In 2011 I stumbled upon NodeJS and shortly thereafter, Meteor, and I've been happily working in JavaScript stacks ever since.
